Natours – A Tour Booking Backend API
  Hey there!  
  This is a Node.js API project I built while learning backend development.  
  It’s a backend system for a tour booking platform — something like a simplified version of what a travel site might use.  

Built With:
- Node.js + Express  
- MongoDB + Mongoose  
- JWT Authentication & Authorization  
- REST API with MVC Pattern  
- Postman for Testing  
- Deployment (Render)  
- Pug (Template Engine)

Features:
- Signup / login / protected routes  
- Only admins can manage tours  
- Filter, sort, and paginate tours  
- Users can make bookings (via API)  
- Geo-location-based tour search  
- Secure user authentication and role-based access  
- Stripe-style payment simulation for bookings  
- Basic image upload and file handling  
- Data sanitization, rate limiting, and error handling middleware  
- Fully structured MVC architecture


What I Learned
- How to build a scalable project using the MVC pattern  
- Managing complex API routes and middleware stacks  
- Writing reusable code (like custom error handlers and query filters)  
- Setting up user roles and access control  
- Connecting MongoDB with Mongoose and designing schemas  
- Using Postman to test and debug API flows efficiently
